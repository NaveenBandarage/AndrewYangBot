# Andrew Yang Twitter Bot

This is a twitter python bot that was made for the purpose of supporting Andrew Yang's campaign. 

## Installation

Really the only thing you need to use is your own twitter api key's as well as you need to install tweepy. I have regenerated the keys so the ones that you saw in the video and are in the text file are unusable and are only for reference. 

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

## Usage
